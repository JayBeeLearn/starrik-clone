        accordance with the General Terms, Agreement as well as laws and
        regulations applicable in the state where you are providing Dispatch
        Services. Please note that you are fully liable for any violation of any

        Services. 4.2. You must have all licenses (including a valid Driver’s
        license), permits, vehicle insurance, liability insurance (if
        applicable), registrations, certifications and other documentation that
        are required in the applicable jurisdiction for providing the Dispatch
        Services. It is your obligation to maintain the validity of all
        aforementioned documentations. Starrik reserves the right to require you
        to present evidence and submit for review all the necessary licenses,
        permits, approvals, authority, registrations and certifications. 4.3.
        You must provide the Dispatch Services in a professional manner in
        accordance with the business ethics applicable to providing such
        services and endeavour to perform the Customer's request in the best
        interest of the Customer. Among else, you: (i) must take the route least
        costly for the Customer, unless the Customer explicitly requests
        otherwise; (ii) may not make any unauthorised stops; (iii) may not carry
        any other package in the vehicle other than the packages or
        packagespermitted by the customer; and (iv) must adhere to any
        applicable traffic acts and regulations, i.e must not conduct any
        actions that may disrupt driving or the perception of traffic
        conditions, including holding a phone in his/her hand while the vehicle
        is moving. (v) will NOT surcharge or request any additional or illegal
        charges from the customer, other than as displayed on the Starrik
        platform for the respective order. This is a very punishable offence. If
        caught or reported by the customer, you may be prosecuted or asked to
        pay a fine Fifteen thousand Naira (NGN 15,000.00), and if repeatedly
        done, you may cease the right to use Starrik platform and own a rider
        account. However, in situations or occasions you examine, evaluate and
        analyze that the charges our below what is fair for both you and the
        customer, you can write to us or draw our attention to it, stating the
        amount you deem fair enough. Nevertheless, the request will be subject
        to our own examination, evaluation and analysis. 4.4. You retain the
        sole right to determine when you are providing the Dispatch Services.
        You shall accept, decline or ignore Dispatch Services requests made by
        Customers at your own choosing. 4.5. Costs you incur while providing the
        Dispatch Services. You are obliged to provide and maintain all equipment
        and means that are necessary to perform the Dispatch Services at your
        own expense, including a vehicle, smartphone, etc. You are also
        responsible for paying all costs you incur in the course of performing
        the Dispatch Services including, but not limited to, fuel, mobile data
        plan costs, duty fees, amortization of the vehicle, insurance, relevant
        corporate or payroll taxes etc. Please bear in mind that using the
        Starrik App may bring about consummation of large amount of data on your
        mobile data plan. Thus, we suggest you to subscribe for a data plan with
        unlimited or very high data usage capacity. 4.6. Fares. You are entitled
        to charge a fare for each instance you have accepted a Customer on the
        Starrik Platform and completed the Dispatch Service as requested (i.e.
        Fare). The Fare is calculated based on a default base fare, the distance
        of the specific journey as determined by the GPS-based device and the
        duration of the specific delivery. The default base fare may fluctuate
        based on the local market situation. In markets with In-app payment, you
        may negotiate the Fare by sending us a pertinent request that has been
        either signed digitally or by hand (in reference to 4.3 v above).
        Additionally, you shall always have the right to charge the Customer
        less than the Fare indicated by the Starrik App. However, charging the
        Customer less than the Starrik App indicates, does not decrease the
        Starrik Fee. 4.7. Upfront Fare. A Customer may be offered to use anorder
        option that allows the Customer to agree to a fixed Fare for a given
        instance of Dispatch Service provided by you (i.e Upfront Fare). Upfront
        Fare is communicated via the Starrik App to a Customer before the order
        is requested, and to you when the order is accepted or at the end of the
        order. The Fare calculated in accordance with section 4.6 shall be
        applied instead of Upfront Fare if the Customer changes the destination
        during the order, the order takes materially longer than estimated due
        to traffic or other factors, or when other unexpected circumstances
        impact the characteristics of the order materially (e.g a route is used
        where tolls apply). 4.8. In markets with In-app payment, if you find
        that there has been an error in the calculation of the Fare and wish to
        make corrections in the calculation of the Fare, you must submit a
        petition in the section “Fare Review” of the Starrik App or write to us
        via email or such other means. If a petition in the section “Fare
        Review” of the Starrik App has not been submitted, then Starrik shall
        not recalculate the Fare or reimburse you for an error made in the
        calculation of the Fare. This option is not applicable in markets with
        only cash payment. 4.9. Starrik may adjust the Fare for a particular
        order completed, if we detect a violation (such as taking a longer route
        or not stopping the fare meter of the Starrik App after the Dispatch
        Services have been completed) or in case of a technical error affecting
        the final fare is identified. Starrik may also reduce or cancel the fare
        in case we have reasonable cause to suspect a fraud or a complaint by
        the Customer indicates a violation by you. Starrik will only exercise
        its right to reduce or cancel the fare in a reasonable and justified
        manner. 4.10. Customer may have the option to pay the fare for the
        Dispatch Services either directly to you or via the In-app Payment, in
        markets where this option is available, as described in section 6 of
        these General Terms. In case the Customer pays the Fare directly, it is
        your obligation to collect the Fare. In case the Customer fails or
        refuses to pay, Starrik will send a notice of debt to the Customer on
        behalf of you. Such authorisation derives from the mandate of paying
        agent given to Starrik and does not entail that Starrik has an
        obligation to compensate the Fare not paid by the Customer. If the
        recipient of the package does not agree to pay the Fare for the
        provision of Dispatch Service, where there is such understanding or
        agreement, the Fare will be paid by the Customer who has ordered the
        provision of Dispatch Service. If Customer justifiably refuses to pay
        the Fare on the account that your information stated in the Starrik App
        is incorrect, then Starrik will not reimburse you for such expenses.
        4.11 Tips. In some markets Customer may be given the option to tip you
        after a successful provision of Dispatch Services. The Customer can Tip
        you only by means authorised by Starrik for Tipping. The Tip will not
        affect the amount of Starrik Fees and Starrik will not collect a
        commission on the Tip paid by the Customer. You are obliged to fully
        comply with any tax obligations arising from the Tipping. We may limit
        the maximum value of a Tip at our sole discretion. 4.12. Receipts. After
        each successful provision of Dispatch Services, Starrik shall create and
        forward a receipt to the Customer consisting of some or all of the
        following information: the company’s business name, place of business,
        the first name and surname of the Rider, a photo of the Rider, service
        license number (if applicable), the registration number of the vehicle,
        the date, the time, the start and end locations, the duration and
        length, the Fare and the FareTip paid for the provision of the Dispatch
        Services. The receipt of each provision of Dispatch Services is
        available to you via the StarrikRider Account. 4.13. Cancellation fee &
        wait time fee. Customer may cancel a request for Dispatch Services that
        a Rider has accepted via the Starrik App. In some markets, Rider may be
        entitled to the Fare for cancelled Dispatch Services (Cancellation Fee)
        in the event that a customer cancels accepted request for Dispatch
        Services after certain time period determined by Starrik App. 4.14. If,
        in the course of the provision of the Dispatch Services, a Customer or
        its co-Customers negligently damage the vehicle or its furnishing (among
        else, by blemishing or staining the vehicle or causing the vehicle to
        stink), you shall have the right to request the Customer to pay a
        penalty up to NGN20,000.00 and request compensation for any damages
        exceeding the penalty. If the Customer does not consent to paying the
        penalty and/or compensating the damage, you must notify us and we will
        then try to collect penalty and/or relevant costs on your behalf from
        the Customer. However, bear in mind that we are not be taking any
        liability for direct or indirect damages in relation to repairing or
        maintenance of the vehicle caused by Customer. 4.15. Your tax
        obligations. You hereby acknowledge that you are obliged to fully comply
        with all tax obligations that arise to you from the applicable laws in
        relation to providing the Dispatch Services, including (i) paying income
        tax, social security tax or any other tax applicable; and (ii)
        fulfilling all employee and tax registration obligations for
        calculations in regard to accounting and transfers to applicable State
        authorities as required by the applicable law. In case the Tax authority
        will submit a valid application to us to provide information regarding
        the activities of you, we may make available to the Tax authority the
        information regarding the activities of you to the extent set forth in
        valid legal acts. Additionally, it is your obligation to adhere to all
        applicable tax regulations that may apply in connection with the
        provision of Dispatch Services. You hereby agree to compensate Starrik
        all state fees, claims, payments, fines or other tax obligations that
        Starrik will incur in connection with the obligations arising from
        applicable tax regulations not having been met by you (including paying
        the income tax and social tax). 4.16. The Rider’s authorisation to issue
        invoices. Starrik has a right to issue an invoice on your behalf to the
        Customer in order to compensate you any Fares, contractual penalties or
        other fees that Starrik mediates to you. In markets where Starrik issues
        invoices, the invoice will be made available to you via the StarrikRider
        Account. 5. STARRIK FEES 5.1. In order to use the Starrik Services, you

        right to distribute promo code to Riders at our discretion on a per
        promotional basis. You are required to accept the use of promo code only
        when the Rider applies the code in-app to a trip using card payment.
        Promo codes may not be applied to cash paid deliveries. If the use of
        promo codes is suspected as being fraudulent, illegal, used by a Rider
        in conflict with our Terms and Conditions relating to promo code use,
        then the promo code may be canceled and the outstanding amount will not
        be reimbursed by Starrik to the Rider. 6.4 If the option is available
        and the Customer chooses to Tip you directly in the Starrik App, the Tip
        will be collected by Starrik on your behalf together with the Fares and
        other fees paid by the Customer via the In-app Payment. If the payment
        of the Tip is suspected as being fraudulent, illegal, for a purpose
        other than as a gratuity related to the service provided or used by a
        Rider in conflict with our Terms and Conditions and, then the Tip can be
        withheld by Starrik. 6.5. You are entitled to review In-app Payment
        reports in the StarrikRider Account or App. The reports will show the
        amounts of the In-app Payments brokered in the previous week as well as
        the withheld amounts of the Starrik Fee. You must notify us of any
        important circumstances which may affect our obligations to collect and
        distribute the Fares paid via In-app Payment. 6.6. We are not obliged to
        pay you the Fare due from the Customer if the In-app Payment failed
        because Customer’s credit card or other payment is cancelled or is
        unsuccessful for other reasons. In such case we will help you in
        requesting the Fare due from the Customer and shall transmit it to you
        once the Customer has made the requested payment. 6.7. Before providing
        Dispatch Services, you must verify that the service is being actually
        provided to the right Customer or the Customer has expressly confirmed
        he/she allows other Customers to order under Customer’s account. If you
        make a mistake in identifying the Customer, and the In-app Payment is
        charged to a person, who has not been provided or has not approved the
        Dispatch Services for other Customers, then we shall reimburse the
        person for the Fare. In such case you are not entitled to receive the
        Fare from us. Additionally, for every wrongfully applied In-app Payment,
        we shall be entitled to charge you a contractual penalty up to
        NGN2,500.00 6.8. Please note that we will set off any Fares or Tip paid
        via In-app Payment against the amounts that you are obliged to pay to us
        (i.e. Starrik Fees and contractual penalties). We reserve the right to
        fulfil any of your financial liabilities to any Starrik group affiliate,
        in which case we will acquire the right to submit a claim against you.
        We may set off any of your financial liabilities against financial
        liabilities that you may have against us. 6.9. If we are not able to pay
        the Fees or Tip to you due to you not including your bank account
        details in your Rider´s account or if the bank account details have been
        noted incorrectly, then we will hold such payments for 60 days. If you
        do not notify us of the correct bank account details within 60 days from
        the date that the right to claim such payments has been established,
        your claim regarding the payment of the Fare or Tip not transferred to
        you shall expire. 7. CUSTOMER SUPPORT We provide the Riders customer
        support regarding the use of the Starrik Services. We have the right to
        stop providing the customer support services in case you are in delay
        with any of the payments for more than 5 (five) calendar days. 8.
        RATINGS AND ACTIVITY 8.1. In order to guarantee high-quality service and
        provide additional reassurance to Customers, you hereby acknowledge that
        the Customers may provide you a rating and leave feedback regarding the
        quality of the Dispatch Services that you have provided. Your average
        rating will be linked to your Rider´s account and will be available to
        Customers at Starrik App. If we find out the rating or comment is not
        given in good faith, this rating or comment may not be projected in the
        calculations of your rating. 8.2. In addition to the rating, we measure
        your level of activity and provide you with an activity score, which is
        based on your activity regarding accepting, declining, not responding
        and completing Dispatch Service requests. 8.3. In order to provide
        reliable services to Customers, we may determine a minimum average
        rating and a minimum activity score that Riders must establish and
        maintain. If, after a pertinent notification from us, you do not
        increase your average rating or activity score to minimum level within
        the prescribed time period, your Rider´s account will be automatically
        suspended either temporarily or permanently. We may reverse the
        suspension of your account if it is merited by any external
        circumstances or it is detected that the suspension was caused by a
        system error or false ratings. 9. MARKET OVERVIEWS AND CAMPAIGNS 9.1.
        Market overviews. We may send you, via the Starrik App, StarrikRider
        Account, SMS, email or other means, market overviews, in order to
        increase your awareness regarding when the demand by the Customers is
        highest. Such market overviews are merely recommendatory and do not
        constitute any obligations for you. As the market overview estimations
        are based on previous statistics, we cannot give any guarantees that the
        actual market situation will correspond to the estimations provided in
        the market overview. 9.2. Campaigns promising minimum income. We may
        also provide campaigns, whereby we will guarantee a minimum income if
        you provide Dispatch Services within a specified timeframe. If the
        specified minimum is not reached by you, we shall compensate the gap.
        The specific requirements and conditions will be sent via the Starrik
        App, StarrikRider Account, SMS, e-mail or other means. We have full
        discretion in deciding if, when and to which Riders we provide such
        campaigns. If we have reasonable cause to suspect any fraudulent
        activity by you, we may withhold your Fare until the suspicion of fraud
        has been cleared. 9.3. Campaigns for Customers. We may also occasionally
        arrange various campaigns to Customers in order to promote the Starrik
        Platform. If the Fare paid by the Customers is reduced as part of such
        campaign, we shall pay you compensation, amounting to the monetary value
        of the benefit offered to the Customers. We may set off the marketing
        compensation against the Starrik Fee. 10. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU, US
        AND THE CUSTOMERS 10.1. You hereby acknowledge and agree that we provide
        an information society service and do not provide Dispatch Services. By
