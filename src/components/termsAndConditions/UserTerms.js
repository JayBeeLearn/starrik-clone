          GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USERS (CUSTOMERS) ON THE USE OF
          STARRIK APP. These General Terms and Conditions set out the terms and
          conditions applying to and governing the usage of the Starrik – a
          courier technology platform which connects owners of packages and
          items with Riders to help dispatch them across locations in the world
          more efficiently, effectively and excellently. The term “us” or “we”
          refers to Starrik Technology Company Limited - a private limited
          liability company incorporated and registered with the Corporate
          Affairs Commission (CAC) under the laws of the Federal Republic of
          Nigeria with Registration Certificate 7404039 and its registered
          office situate at Prince EnobongUwah Street, Uyo, Akwa Ibom State –
          Nigeria, or other Starrik allied services or cooperation partner(s)
          where Starrik Services are not directly provided by Starrik Technology
          Company Limited. For reference purposes, ("delivery, logistics,
          courier, dispatch") all mean the same thing and they refer to services
          of moving properties around, provided by Starrik Riders or such
          services provided by the cooperate partners with the consent and
          approval by Starrik Technology Company Limited. In order to use
          Starrik app you MUST agree to the terms and conditions that are under
          listed below. Your access and use of the Services constitutes your
          agreement to be bound by these Terms, which establishes a contractual
          relationship between you and Starrik Technology Company Limited.
          Please note that you may not access or use the Services if you do not
          agree to these Terms as these Terms expressly supersede prior
          agreements or arrangements with you. 1. Using the Starrik app 1.1
          Starrik mediates a courier service through Starrik app that enables
          mediation of the requests for dispatch services between the Customers
          and Riders. Courier services are provided by Riders (Independent
          Third-Party Contractors) under a contract (with you) for the carriage
          of goods. Riders provide courier or dispatch services on an
          independent basis (either as independent Riders or as a company) as
          economic and professional service providers. Starrik is not
          responsible in any way for the fulfilment of the contract entered into
          between the Customer (you) and the Rider. Disputes arising from
          consumer rights, legal obligations or from law applicable to the
          provision of courier services will be resolved between the Customers
          and Riders. Data regarding the Riders and their dispatch services are
          available on the Starrik app and receipts for orders are sent to the
          email address listed in Customer’s profile. 1.2. The Customer (you)
          enters into a contract with the Rider for the provision of dispatch
          services via the Starrik app. You can choose whether to pay the Rider
          for the dispatch service in cash or use Starrik in-App Payment
          depending on the payment options available to you and supported for a
          given location of the journey. Payments for Starrik Business delivery
          is handled by a separate agreement for Business deliveries. Charges
          will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges
          may include other applicable fees, tolls, and/or surcharges including
          a booking fee, municipal tolls, airport surcharges or processing fees
          for split payments. If you wish, you may also choose to pay a Tip to
          the Rider directly or via the use of Starrik inApp Payment. We may
          limit the maximum value of a Tip at our sole discretion. 1.3 During
          the installation of Starrik app, Customer’s mobile number is linked to
          the respective Starrik user account and added to our database. If you
          are no longer using your mobile number, you must notify Starrik within
          7 days so we can anonymize your account data. If you do not notify us
          about any change to your number, your mobile operator may issue the
          same mobile number to a new person who when using the Starrik app then
          may have access to your data. 2. Promotional Activities 2.1 Starrik
          may send you promotional codes on a per promotion basis. Promotional
          code credit can be applied towards payment on completion of an order
          or other features or benefits related to the service and/or a Third
          Party’s service and are subject to any additional terms that are
          established on a per promotional code basis. Expiration dates of promo
          codes will be reflected in-app once you have applied the promo code to
          your account. 2.2 If your delivery amount exceeds the redeemable
          credit allocated to your order, the balance will be automatically
          deducted from your account’s payment method. Similarly, a promotional
          code credit only applies on a per order basis and cannot carry over to
          a next order/ booking and therefore will be forfeited. Only one
          promotional code may be applied per booking. 2.3 Starrik reserves the
          right to cancel any promotional code at any time for any reason. This
          includes, but not limited to, if Starrik deems that codes are being
          used in an unlawful or fraudulent manner, those issued mistakenly, and
          those which have expired. 2.4 Starrik reserves the right to carry out
          its promotional and marketing activities for its new products or
          allied services on the Starrik app, such other platforms connected or
          affiliated to Starrik, your email address via our newsletters or
          targeted emails. 2.5 Starrik understands that you are not a minor or
          under-age. You are up to the age of accountability as accepted in your
          region (e.g in Nigeria, it is 18years above). 3. Starrik in-App
          Payment 3.1 You can pay for the dispatch services with a card, mobile
          carrier billing or other payment methods (e.g: Starrik Business) as
          and when available through Starrik App, depending on the payment
          options available or supported for the given location of the journey.
          By providing Starrik in-App Payment service, Starrik acts as a
          commercial agent for the providers of the dispatch services. Every
          rider has authorisedStarrik as their commercial agent for the
          mediation of conclusion of contracts between the Rider and the
          Customer, including the power to accept payments from the Customers
          and to forward the payments to the Rider. Your obligation to the
          provider of the dispatch service will be fulfilled when the payment
          order is given to transfer funds to Starrik’s bank account. You, as a
          customer are responsible for ensuring that the payment takes place and
          ensuring that sufficient funds are available. 3.2 You may choose to
          pay a Tip to the Rider using the Starrik In-app Payment service. The
          Tip can be paid via the In-app Payment by means authorised by Starrik
          for that purpose. Starrik will not hold a commission for the brokerage
          of the Tip and the Tip will be transferred to the Rider in full
          amount, excluding any taxes, if applicable. Starrik reserves the right
          to withhold the Tip, if the payment of the Tip is suspected as being
          fraudulent, illegal, for a purpose other than as a gratuity related to
          the service provided or used in conflict with Starrik’s Terms and
          Conditions 3.3 When making payments by Starrik in-App Payment, Starrik
          receives your payments and forwards money to the Rider. Starrik may
          ask additional data from you to verify payment method. 3.4 When making
          payments by Starrik in-App Payment for dispatch services, Starrik is
          not responsible for possible third-party payment costs (e.g mobile
          operators, bank fees). These service providers may charge you
          additional fees when processing payments in connection with the
          Starrik in-App Payment. Starrik is not responsible for any such fees
          and disclaims all liability in this regard. Your payment method may
          also be subject to additional terms and conditions imposed by the
          applicable third-party payment service provider; please review these
          terms and conditions before using your payment method. 3.5 Starrik
          will be responsible for the functioning of Starrik in-App Payment and
          provide support in resolving problems. The resolution of disputes
          related to Starrik in-App Payment also takes place through us. For
          payment support service please contact: info@Starrik.com. Enquiries
          submitted by e-mail or Starrik App will receive a response within 72
          working hours. Starrik will resolve Starrik in-App Payment related
          complaints and applications within 5 working days. 3.6. Upfront Fare.
          You may be offered to use an order option that allows you to agree to
          a fixed Fare for a given instance of Dispatch service provided by the
          Rider (i.e Upfront Fare). Upfront Fare is communicated to you via the
          Starrik App before the order is requested. Upfront Fare shall not be
          applied if you change the destination during the order, the order
          takes materially longer than estimated due to traffic or other
          factors, or when other unexpected circumstances impact the
          characteristics of the order materially (e.g a route is used where
          tolls apply). 4. Ordering and Cancelling Dispatch services 4.1 If you
          order a dispatch service and the Rider has agreed to undertake the
          work, then the dispatch service is considered to be ordered. 4.2 Once
          a Rider confirms that he/she will complete your order, you will enter
          into a separate agreement with the Rider for the provision of the
          delivery on such terms and conditions as you agree with the Rider.
          Starrik does not provide delivery services and is not a party to your
          agreement with the relevant Rider. 4.3 Cancelling the use of an
          ordered dispatch service is considered to be the situation where the
          Rider has replied to your request and you subsequently reject, cancel
          or refuse the dispatch service. When a dispatch service request is
          cancelled after certain time period you are required to pay a
          cancellation fee. 4.4 If you cancel a dispatch service request on
          multiple successive instances within 24-hours, we may temporarily
          block your account for warning. After multiple such warnings, we may
          suspend your account for longer period (e.g 6 months). After that
          period, you could ask to reactivate your account and your application
          will be reviewed by Starrik. 4.5 When the Rider notifies the Customer
          about his/her arrival to the requested destination and the Customer or
          people for whom the dispatch was ordered do not arrive at the
          destination within certain time period as specified in the Starrik
          app, the request will be deemed cancelled. Sometimes the Rider may
          decide to cancel your request, please note that Starrik is not
          responsible for such situations. 4.6 Once the rider arrives and sends
          you a notification that he/she has arrived, the Starrik app may begin
          charging fare on a waiting time basis according to the rates specified
          in the Starrik app. 4.7 If you have requested dispatch services using
          the Starrik app and cause damage to the Rider’s vehicle or its
          furnishing (among else, by blemishing or staining the vehicle or
          causing the vehicle to stink), the Rider will have the right to
          require you to pay a penalty of NGN 20,000.00 and require compensation
          for any damages exceeding the penalty. If you do not pay the penalty
          and/or compensate the damage, Starrik may pursue the claims on behalf
          of the provider of the dispatch service. 5. License to Use Starrik App
          5.1 As long as you comply with these General Terms and Conditions, we
          agree to grant you a royalty free, revocable, non-exclusive, right to
          access and use the Starrik app in accordance with these General Terms
          and Conditions, the Privacy Notice and the applicable app-store terms.
          You may not transfer or sub-license this right to use the Starrik app.
          In the event that your right to use Starrik app is cancelled, the
          corresponding non-exclusive license will also be cancelled. 6.
          Liability 6.1 As the Starrik app is an information technology service
          (a means of communication) between Customers and Riders, we cannot
          guarantee or take any responsibility for the quality or the absence or
          defects in the provision of dispatch services. As the usage of Starrik
          app for requesting dispatch services depends on the behaviour of the
          Riders, Starrik does not guarantee that you will always have offers
          available for the provision of the dispatch services. 6.2 The Starrik
          app does not offer or broker dispatch services for Customers. It is
          also not a dispatch agency service for finding Customers for dispatch
          providers. The Starrik app is used as the means for organising the
          provision of dispatch services. 6.3 The consumer’s right of refund is
          not applied to Starrik app orders. Requesting a refund from the
          dispatch service does not withdraw you from the agreement in the
          course of which the provision of the dispatch service was ordered. 6.4
          The Starrik app is provided on an "as is" and “as available” basis.
          Starrik does not represent, warrant or guarantee that access to
          Starrik app will be uninterrupted or error free. In case of any faults
          in the software, we will endeavour to correct them as soon as
          possible, but please keep in mind that the functioning of the app may
          be restricted due to occasional technical errors and we are not able
          to guarantee that the app will function at all times, for example a
          public emergency may result in a service interruption. 6.5 Starrik,
          its representatives, directors and employees are not liable for any
          loss or damage that you may incur as a result of using Starrik app or
          relying on, the delivery service contracted for through the Starrik
          app, including but not limited to: 6.5.1. any direct or indirect
          property damage or monetary loss, 6.5.2. loss of profit, 6.5.3. loss
          of business, contracts, contacts, goodwill, reputation and any loss
          that may arise from interruption of the business, 6.5.4. loss or
          inaccuracy of data, and/or 6.5.5. any other type of loss or damage.
          6.6 The financial liability of Starrik in connection with breach of
          the contract will be limited to NGN 50,000.00 You will have the right
          to claim for damages only if Starrik has deliberately violated the
          contract. Starrik will not be liable for the actions or inactions of
          the Rider and will not be liable for damages that the Rider causes to
          the Customer. 6.7 You agree to fully indemnify and hold Starrik, its
          parent Company, its affiliate companies, representatives, employees
          and directors harmless from any claims or losses (including
          liabilities, damages, costs and expenses of any nature) that they
          suffer as a result of your use of the Starrik app (including the
          services you obtain through your use of the Starrik app). 6.8 Starrik
          may immediately end your use of the Starrik app if you breach these
          General Terms and Conditions or we consider it necessary to protect
          the integrity of Starrik or the safety of Riders. 6.9 You agree to
          engage us privately in peaceful dialogue through one-on-one meeting,
          phone call, email, written letter, SMS, or such other means of
          communication, with due acknowledgement of the receipt of your
          complaints by us, in situations you feel we have breached our service
          agreement or offer substandard service, with no conscious or
          unconscious contradiction to any part of these General Terms and
          conditions. However, you may proceed with legal actions if you are not
          satisfied with the outcome or result of such peaceful dialogue. But
          taking any legal action against the company without first engaging the
          company in a peaceful conversation renders your legal action
          inconsistent with our general terms and conditions and we have the
          right to request that you fully indemnify us of all expenses and
          liabilities from your legal action and may proceed further to charge
          for what we may tag as “Legal or Corporate Defamation” against
          Starrik, especially in situation we would have admitted our
          shortcomings if peacefully engaged. 7. Good Practice Using the Starrik
          App 7.1 As Starrik is not a provider or broker of the dispatch
          services, any issues with defects or quality of the dispatch services
          will be resolved in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
          dispatch service provider or the relevant public authority. 7.2 We ask
          you to fill out a feedback form in the Starrik app. This enables us to
          offer suggestions to the Riders for improving the quality of their
          services. 7.3 We expect that you use Starrik app in good faith and be
          respectful of the Riders who offer their services through Starrik app.
          Starrik retains the right to close your account if you have violated
          the terms set out in this General Terms and Conditions or if your
          activities are malicious, i.e. withholding payment for the provision
          of the dispatch service, fraud, being disrespectful towards the
          Riders, etc. In these cases, your Starrik app account may be revoked
          without prior notice. 7.4 Starrik will make every effort to ensure
          that only Riders, who have integrity and are respectful of their
          profession and Customers, use the Starrik app. However, we are in no
          position to guarantee that every provider of dispatch services,
          located by the Starrik app, satisfies the aforementioned criteria at
          all times. If you experience objectionable dispatch service, please
          notify the company or individual responsible for the service, a
          supervisory authority (especially in the case of independent Riders or
          our customer support). 8. Amendments to the General Terms and
          Conditions 8.1 If any substantial amendments are made to the General
          Terms and Conditions, then you will be notified by e-mail or Starrik
          app notifications. If you continue using Starrik app, you will be
          deemed to accept the amendments. 9. Final Provisions The General Terms
          and Conditions will be governed by and construed and enforced in
          accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, a country
          in West Africa. If the respective dispute resulting from General Terms
          or Agreement could not be settled by negotiations or dialogues, then
          the dispute will be finally resolved in the Supreme Court of Nigeria,
          Nigeria. If any provision of the General Terms is held to be
          unenforceable, the parties will substitute for the affected provision
          an enforceable provision that approximates the intent and economic
          effect of the affected provision. DATE OF ENTRY INTO FORCE AND
          EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS IS 1st MAY, 2024.
